# Homify

Homify is a web application designed to simplify the process of booking hostels or homestays, whether you're traveling solo or as a group. With Homify, users can create or join parties for homestays, enabling seamless coordination and collaboration among travelers.

## Features:

- **Create and Join Parties:** Users can create parties for homestays, specifying details such as dates, location, and accommodation preferences. Additionally, users can join existing parties created by others, facilitating group bookings.

- **Group Booking:** Homify streamlines the process of booking accommodations for groups by allowing users to book homestays collectively as part of a party. This feature ensures that everyone in the group secures their accommodations effortlessly.

- **Easy Planning:** Planning trips with friends or fellow travelers becomes hassle-free with Homify. Users can organize their travel plans, invite others to join their parties, and coordinate bookings seamlessly within the platform.
